## Overview

Fireball is our app created to track meteorite strikes around the world in a fun and easy way.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Use **search field** to filter meteorite strikes by name, year, mass, composition, and country
- Use a **search bar** located at the top-right of the map to filter by country (with autocomplete)
- **Geolocate** the user to view meteorite strikes near you
- View **summary statistics** including total number of strikes, average mass, and histograms by year and composition
- View **detailed data** of each strike (ie. name, year, composition, country)

For a full set of project requirements, see [here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-project-tier1-fireball/tree/main).
