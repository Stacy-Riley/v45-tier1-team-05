Fireball app is an app created to track meteorite strikes. Key goals for the app include: a search field for being able to filter meteorite strikes by name, strike by year, size and mass, what country the strike occured in, composition of the meteor, and total number of strikes, a display for meteor data showing one dataset per line, and a summary metrics display showing total number of strikes, average mass, a histogram of strikes by year, and a histogram of strikes by composition.
